                   materials and electronic devices made it possible to
                   produce ultrasound (US) in water at high amplitudes,
                   so that it could be detected after propagation
                   through large distances. Laboratory experiments with
                   this new mechanical form of radiation showed that it
                   was capable of producing an astonishing variety of
                   physical, chemical and biologic effects. In this
                   review, the early findings on bioeffects are
                   discussed, especially those from experiments done in
                   the first few decades, as well as the concepts
                   employed in explaining them. Some recent findings are
                   discussed also, noting how the old and the new are
                   related. In the first few decades, bioeffects
                   research was motivated partly by curiosity, and
                   partly by the wish to increase the effectiveness and
                   ensure the safety of therapeutic US. Beginning in the
                   1970s, the motivation has come also from the need for
                   safety guidelines relevant to diagnostic US.
                   Instrumentation was developed for measuring acoustic
                   pressure in the fields of pulsed and focused US
                   employed, and standards were established for
                   specifying the fields of commercial equipment.
                   Critical levels of US quantities were determined from
                   laboratory experiments, together with biophysical
                   analysis, for bioeffects produced by thermal and
                   nonthermal mechanisms. These are the basis for safety
                   advice and guidelines recommended or being considered

  abstract =      {Ultrasonic biophysics is the study of mechanisms
                   responsible for how ultrasound and biological
                   materials interact. Ultrasound-induced bioeffect or
                   risk studies focus on issues related to the effects
                   of ultrasound on biological materials. On the other
                   hand, when biological materials affect the ultrasonic
                   wave, this can be viewed as the basis for diagnostic
                   ultrasound. Thus, an understanding of the interaction
                   of ultrasound with tissue provides the scientific
                   basis for image production and risk assessment.
                   Relative to the bioeffect or risk studies, that is,
                   the biophysical mechanisms by which ultrasound
                   affects biological materials, ultrasound-induced
                   bioeffects are generally separated into thermal and
                   non-thermal mechanisms. Ultrasonic dosimetry is
                   concerned with the quantitative determination of
                   ultrasonic energy interaction with biological
                   materials. Whenever ultrasonic energy is propagated
                   into an attenuating material such as tissue, the
                   amplitude of the wave decreases with distance. This
                   attenuation is due to either absorption or
                   scattering. Absorption is a mechanism that represents
                   that portion of ultrasonic wave that is converted
                   into heat, and scattering can be thought of as that
                   portion of the wave, which changes direction. Because
                   the medium can absorb energy to produce heat, a
                   temperature rise may occur as long as the rate of
                   heat production is greater than the rate of heat
                   removal. Current interest with thermally mediated
                   ultrasound-induced bioeffects has focused on the
                   thermal isoeffect concept. The non-thermal mechanism
                   that has received the most attention is acoustically
                   generated cavitation wherein ultrasonic energy by
                   cavitation bubbles is concentrated. Acoustic
                   cavitation, in a broad sense, refers to
                   ultrasonically induced bubble activity occurring in a
                   biological material that contains pre-existing
                   gaseous inclusions. Cavitation-related mechanisms
                   include radiation force, microstreaming, shock waves,
                   free radicals, microjets and strain. It is more
                   challenging to deduce the causes of mechanical
                   effects in tissues that do not contain gas bodies.
                   These ultrasonic biophysics mechanisms will be
                   discussed in the context of diagnostic ultrasound

                   the spinotrapezius muscle in 15 rats during
                   ultrasound delivery. Microbubble destruction during
                   ultrasound exposure caused rupture of {\textless} or
                   = 7-microm microvessels (mostly capillaries) and the
                   production of nonviable cells in adjacent tissue. The

                   correlated linearly (P{\textless}0.001) with the

                   Microbubbles can be destroyed by ultrasound,

                   Approved agents are suspensions of gas bodies

                   sonoporation and cell death occur at mechanical index
                   (MI) values less than the inertial cavitation
                   threshold. In vivo, bioeffects reported for MI values
                   greater than 0.4 include microvascular leakage,
                   petechiae, cardiomyocyte death, inflammatory cell
                   infiltration, and premature ventricular contractions
                   and are accompanied by gas body destruction within
                   the capillary bed. Bioeffects for MIs of 1.9 or less
                   have been reported in skeletal muscle, fat,
                   myocardium, kidney, liver, and intestine. Therapeutic
                   applications that rely on these bioeffects include
                   targeted drug delivery to the interstitium and DNA
                   transfer into cells for gene therapy. Bioeffects of
                   contrast-aided diagnostic ultrasound happen on a
                   microscopic scale, and their importance in the
                   clinical setting remains uncertain.},

  abstract =      {Non-Newtonian properties on bubble dynamics and
                   cavitation are fundamentally different from those of
                   Newtonian fluids. The most significant effect arises
                   from the dramatic increase in viscosity of polymer
                   solutions in an extensional flow, such as that
                   generated about a spherical bubble during its growth
                   or collapse phase. In addition, many biological
                   fluids, such as blood, synovial fluid, and saliva,
                   have non-Newtonian properties and can display
                   significant viscoelastic behaviour. This monograph
                   elucidates general aspects of bubble dynamics and
                   cavitation in non-Newtonian fluids and applies them
                   to the fields of biomedicine and bioengineering. In
                   addition it presents many examples from the process
                   industries. The field is strongly interdisciplinary
                   and the numerous disciplines involve have and will
                   continue to overlook and reinvent each others' work.
                   This book helps researchers to think intuitively

                   attempt to bridge the various communities involved,
                   and to convey the interest, elegance, and variety of

                   Medical Ultrasound when this subject will be examined
                   in detail by a select group of international experts.
                   The WFUMB-sponsored workshop will take place in
                   Utsunomiya, Japan during 11–15th July, 1994. The
                   purpose of the meeting is to evaluate the scientific
                   literature and to formulate internationally accepted
                   recommendations on the safe use of diagnostic
                   ultrasound that may be endorsed as official policy of
                   the WFUMB. It should be noted that the current
                   publication is not intended for review or endorsement
                   as an official WFUMB document. It is produced as a

                   experimentally the question: "Is the MI (Mechanical
                   Index) an equivalent or better indicator of
                   nonthermal bioeffect risk than I(SPPA.3) (derated
                   spatial peak, pulse average intensity)?" To evaluate
                   this question, the experimental design consisted of a
                   reproducible biological effect in order to provide a
                   quantitative assessment of the effect. The specific
                   biological effect used was lung damage and the
                   species chosen was the rabbit. This work was
                   initiated, in part, by a study in which lung
                   hemorrhage was observed in 7-week old C3H mice for
                   diagnostic-type, pulsed-wave ultrasound exposures,
                   and, therefore, 6- to 7-week old C3H mice were used
                   in this study as positive controls. Forty-seven adult
                   New Zealand White male rabbits were exposed to a wide
                   range of ultrasound amplitude conditions at center
                   frequencies of 3 and 6 MHz with all temporal exposure
                   variables held constant. A calibrated, commercial
                   diagnostic ultrasound system was used as the
                   ultrasound source with output levels exceeding, in
                   some cases, permissible FDA levels. The MI was shown
                   to be at least an equivalent, and in some cases, a
                   better indicator of rabbit lung damage than either
                   the I(SPPA.3) or p(r.3) (derated peak rarefactional
                   pressure), thus answering the posed question
                   positively. Further, in situ exposure conditions were
                   estimated at the lung pleural surface (PS); the
                   estimated in situ I(SPPA.PS) and p(r.PS) exposure
                   conditions tracked lung damage no better than
                   I(SPPA.3) and p(r.3), respectively, whereas the
                   estimated in situ MI(PS) exposure condition was a
                   slightly poorer predictor of lung damage than MI.
                   Finally, the lungs of six adult crossbred pigs were
                   exposed at the highest amplitude exposure levels
                   permitted by a diagnostic ultrasound system (to
                   prevent probe damage) at both frequencies; no lung
                   damage was observed which suggests the possibility of
                   a species dependency biological effect.},

                   (wavelength ???10.6 ??m) was focused (680-??m
                   beamwidth) on the surface of the lungs of rats for a

                   of coagulation of tissue, cells and fluids, whereas
                   injury induced by ultrasound consisted solely of

                   hemorrhage due to exposure to clinical diagnostic
                   levels of ultrasound has been attributed to an
                   inertial cavitation mechanism. The purpose of this
                   article is to report the results of two experiments
                   that directly contradict the hypothesis that
                   ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage is caused by
                   inertial cavitation. Elevated hydrostatic pressure
                   was used to suppress the involvement of inertial
                   cavitation. In experiment one, 160 adult mice were
                   equally divided into two hydrostatic pressure groups
                   (0.1 or 1.1 MPa), and were randomly exposed to pulsed
                   ultrasound (2.8-MHz center frequency, 1-kHz PRF,
                   1.42-micros pulse duration, 10-s exposure duration).
                   For the two hydrostatic pressure groups (80 mice
                   each), 8 in situ peak rarefactional pressure levels
                   were used that ranged between 2.82 and 11.8 MPa (10
                   mice/group). No effect of hydrostatic pressure on the
                   probability of hemorrhage was observed. These data
                   lead to the conclusion that lung hemorrhage is not
                   caused by inertial cavitation. Also, the higher
                   hydrostatic pressure enhanced rather than inhibited
                   the impact of ultrasonic pressure on the severity
                   (hemorrhage area, depth, and volume) of lesions.
                   These counterintuitive findings were confirmed in a
                   second experiment using a 2 x 5 factorial design that
                   consisted of two ultrasonic pressure levels and five
                   hydrostatic pressure levels (100 mice, 10
                   mice/group). If inertial cavitation were the
                   mechanism responsible for lung hemorrhage, then
                   elevated hydrostatic pressures should have resulted
                   in less rather than more tissue damage at each

                   conclusion that the pathogenesis of
                   ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage is not caused by
                   inertial cavitation.},

                   surface pressure (ARSP). ARSP may be a physical
                   mechanism for pulmonary capillary hemorrhage induced
                   by diagnostic ultrasound. Fundamental tissue
                   parameters in biomedical acoustics are the density

                   acoustical impedance z=$\rho$c. Many tissues are
                   similar to water (z = 1,628 krayl), but not lung. The
                   gas content of lung imparts an extreme heterogeneity

                   phenomenon represents the only clearly demonstrated
                   biological effect of (non-contrast enhanced)
                   diagnostic ultrasound and thus presents a uniquely
                   important safety issue. However, the physical
                   mechanism responsible for PCH remains uncertain more
                   than 25 y after its discovery. Experimental research
                   has indicated that neither heating nor acoustic
                   cavitation, the predominant mechanisms for bioeffects
                   of ultrasound, is responsible for PCH. Furthermore,
                   proposed theoretical mechanisms based on gas-body
                   activation, on alveolar resonance and on impulsive
                   generation of liquid droplets all appear unlikely to
                   be responsible for PCH, owing to unrealistic model
                   assumptions. Here, a simple model based on the
                   acoustical radiation surface pressure (ARSP) at a
                   tissue-air interface is hypothesized as the mechanism
                   for PCH. The ARSP model seems to explain some
                   features of PCH, including the approximate frequency
                   independence of PCH thresholds and the dependence of
                   thresholds on biological factors. However, ARSP
                   evaluated for experimental threshold conditions
                   appear to be too weak to fully account for stress
                   failure of pulmonary capillaries, gauging by known
                   stresses for injurious physiologic conditions.
                   Furthermore, consideration of bulk properties of lung
                   tissue suggests substantial transmission of
                   ultrasound through the pleura, with reduced ARSP and
                   potential involvement of additional mechanisms within
                   the pulmonary interior. Although these recent
                   findings advance our knowledge, only a full
                   understanding of PCH mechanisms will allow
                   development of science-based safety assurance for
                   pulmonary ultrasound.},

                   phenomenon that occurs when a focused ultrasound wave
                   in liquid encounters an air interface. High intensity
                   focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been shown to
                   fractionate a tissue into submicron-sized fragments
                   in a process termed boiling histotripsy, wherein the
                   focused ultrasound wave superheats the tissue at the
                   focus, producing a millimetre-sized boiling or vapour
                   bubble in several milliseconds. Yet the question of
                   how this millimetre-sized boiling bubble creates
                   submicron-sized tissue fragments remains. The
                   hypothesis of this work is that the tissue can behave
                   as a liquid such that it atomizes and forms a
                   fountain within the vapour bubble produced in boiling
                   histotripsy. We describe an experiment, in which a
                   2 MHz HIFU transducer (maximum in situ intensity of
                   24 000 W cm(-2)) was aligned with an air-tissue
                   interface meant to simulate the boiling bubble.
                   Atomization and fountain formation was observed with
                   high-speed photography and resulted in tissue
                   erosion. Histological examination of the atomized
                   tissue showed whole and fragmented cells and nuclei.
                   Air-liquid interfaces were also filmed. Our
                   conclusion was that HIFU can fountain and atomize
                   tissue. Although this process does not entirely mimic
                   what was observed in liquids, it does explain many
                   aspects of tissue fractionation in boiling
                   histotripsy.},

                   and gravitational forces is considered. This
                   construct was motivated by the occurrence of lung
                   haemorrhage resulting from ultrasonic imaging and
                   pursues the notion that bursts of ultrasound act to
                   expel droplets that puncture the soft air-filled sacs
                   in the lung plural surface, allowing them to fill
                   with blood. The tissue adjacent to the sacs is
                   modelled as a liquid and the air–tissue interface
                   in the sacs as a free surface. The evolution of the
                   free surface is described by a boundary-integral
                   formulation and, since the free surface evolves
                   slowly relative to the bursts of ultrasound, they are
                   realized as an impulse at the free surface,
                   represented by the velocity potential. As the free
                   surface evolves, it is seen to form axisymmetric
                   surface jets, waves or droplets, depending upon the
                   levels of gravity and surface tension. Moreover the
                   droplets may be spherical and ejected away from the
                   surface or an inverted tear shape and fall back to
                   the surface. These conclusions are expressed in a
                   phase diagram of inverse Froude number Fr−1 versus
                   inverse Weber number We−1. Specifically, while
                   axisymmetric surface jets form in the absence of
                   surface tension and gravity, gravity acts to bound
                   their height, rendering them waves, although
                   instability overrides the calculation prior to its
                   reaching that bound. Surface tension acts to suppress
                   the instability (provided that We−1 {\textgreater}
                   0.045) and to form drops; if sufficiently strong it
                   can also damp the evolving wave, causing it to
                   collapse. The pinchoff which effects spherical drops
                   is of power-law type with exponent 2/3, and the
                   universal constant that relates the necking radius to
                   the time from pinchoff, thereby realizing a

                   droplets; however, while, in their paper, they form
                   as a result of gravity, those reported here form as a
                   result of surface tension. It is also found that the

                   power-law type with exponent 2/3 irrespective of the

                   when a shock wave interacts with an interface
                   separating two different fluids. It combines
                   compressible phenomena, such as shock interaction and
                   refraction, with hydrodynamic instability, including
                   nonlinear growth and subsequent transition to
                   turbulence, across a wide range of Mach numbers. This
                   review focuses on the basic physical processes
                   underlying the onset and development of the
                   Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in simple geometries.

                   waves. To illustrate and elucidate the physical
                   effects that modify wave propagation, we consider
                   three examples of increasing complexity: wave
                   propagation supported by a uniform background flow;
                   wave propagation supported on a piecewise-linear
                   basic state possessing one jump; and an instability
                   problem of a piecewise-linear basic state possessing
                   two jumps, which supports the possibility of shear
                   instability. We find that the non-Boussinesq effects
                   introduce a preference for the direction of wave
                   propagation that depends on the sign of the shear in
                   the region where waves are supported. This in turn
                   affects phase-locking of waves that is crucial for
                   the mechanistic interpretation for shear instability,
                   and is seen here to have an inherent tendency for

                   driven by ultrasonic fields is an important problem
                   in biomedical acoustics. Keller-Miksis equation,
                   which can account for the large amplitude
                   oscillations of bubbles, is rederived in this paper
                   and combined with a viscoelastic model to account for
                   the strain-stress relation. The viscoelastic model
                   used in this study is the Voigt model. It is shown
                   that only the viscous damping term in the original
                   equation needs to be modified to account for the
                   effect of elasticity. With experiment determined
                   viscoelastic properties, the effects of elasticity on
                   bubble oscillations are studied. Specifically, the
                   inertial cavitation thresholds are determined using
                   R(max)/R(0), and subharmonic signals from the

                   increases the threshold pressure for a bubble to
                   oscillate inertially, and subharmonic signals may
                   only be detectable in certain ranges of radius and
                   pressure amplitude. These results should be easy to
                   verify experimentally, and they may also be useful in

                   dynamics of cavitation microbubbles in viscoelastic
                   media must be determined. For this theoretical study,
                   measured 1.5 to 7.5 MHz pulse pressure waveforms,
                   which were used in experimental determinations of
                   capillary breaching thresholds for contrast-enhanced
                   diagnostic ultrasound in a rat kidney, were used to
                   calculate cavitation nucleated from contrast agent
                   microbubbles. A numerical model for cavitation in
                   tissue was developed based on the Keller-Miksis
                   equation (a compressible extension of the

                   the experimentally obtained capillary breaching

                   anesthetized rats exposed to 1.5-, 4.5- and 12.0-MHz
                   diagnostic ultrasound to investigate the frequency

                   was assessed using photographs of the surface of
                   excised lungs. Previous photographs acquired after
                   exposure to 7.6-MHz diagnostic ultrasound were
                   included for analysis. In addition, at each frequency
                   we measured dosimetric parameters, including peak
                   rarefactional pressure amplitude and spatial peak,
                   pulse average intensity attenuated by rat chest wall
                   samples. Peak rarefactional pressure amplitude
                   thresholds determined at each frequency, based on the
                   proportion of PCH in groups of five rats, were 1.03

                   Although the PCH lesions decreased in size with
                   increasing ultrasonic frequency, owing to the smaller
                   beam widths and scan lengths, the peak rarefactional
                   pressure amplitude thresholds remained approximately
                   constant. This dependence was different from that of
                   the mechanical index, which indicates a need for a

                   estimation of alveolar number in the human lung. The

                   elasticity of the connective tissue including lung
                   parenchyma. The glycosaminoglycans on the
                   proteoglycans may also play a role because osmolarity
                   of interstitial fluid can alter the repulsive forces
                   on the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans,
                   allowing them to collapse or inflate, which can
                   affect the stretching and folding pattern of the
                   fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that the elasticity of
                   lung tissue arises primarily from 1) the topology of
                   the collagen-elastin network and 2) the mechanical
                   interaction between proteoglycans and fibers. We
                   measured the quasi-static, uniaxial stress-strain
                   curves of lung tissue sheets in hypotonic, normal,
                   and hypertonic solutions. We found that the
                   stress-strain curve was sensitive to osmolarity, but
                   this sensitivity decreased after proteoglycan
                   digestion. Images of immunofluorescently labeled
                   collagen networks showed that the fibers follow the
                   alveolar walls that form a hexagonal-like structure.
                   Despite the large heterogeneity, the aspect ratio of
                   the hexagons at 30{\%} uniaxial strain increased
                   linearly with osmolarity. We developed a
                   two-dimensional hexagonal network model of the
                   alveolar structure incorporating the mechanical
                   properties of the collagen-elastin fibers and their
                   interaction with proteoglycans. The model accounted
                   for the stress-strain curves observed under all
                   experimental conditions. The model also predicted how
                   aspect ratio changed with osmolarity and strain,

                   measured 1.5 to 7.5 MHz pulse pressure waveforms,
                   which were used in experimental determinations of

                   calculate cavitation nucleated from contrast agent
                   microbubbles. A numerical model for cavitation in
                   tissue was developed based on the Keller-Miksis
                   equation (a compressible extension of the

                   in liquids by rapid changes, such as those introduced

                   with the short pulses of ultrasound (US) used in
                   medical diagnosis, there was little need for concern
                   about the possibility of inertial cavitation in vivo.
                   This assumption came into question when experimental
                   evidence indicated that killing of fruit fly larvae
                   by diagnostically relevant US was associated with the
                   presence of gas in the respiratory apparatus of the
                   organisms. Independent theoretical contributions by
                   Flynn and Apfel in the early 1980s made it clear that
                   complacency in regard to cavitation was not
                   warranted. Later, the mammalian lung, as with larva,
                   was shown to be particularly vulnerable when it
                   contained air. Yet, overall evidence suggests that
                   lung hemorrhage is not consistent with the classical
                   picture of inertial cavitation. Most recently,
                   however, hemolysis and hemorrhage associated with the
                   use of contrast agents have provided nearly
                   incontrovertible evidence of the occurrence of

                   acoustic wave or other mechanical stress, such nuclei
                   will quickly dissolve and disappear from the medium.
                   Under the influence of an acoustic wave, however,
                   these microbubbles may grow to many times their

                   compared with the previously developed linear
                   viscoelastic model. Results are found to agree in the
                   limit of small deformations; however, significant
                   divergence for larger radial oscillations is noted.
                   Furthermore, the inherent limitations of the linear
                   viscoelastic approach are explored in light of the
                   more complete nonlinear formulation. The relevance
                   and importance of this approach to biomedical
                   ultrasound applications are highlighted. Preliminary
                   results indicate that tissue viscoelasticity may be
                   an important consideration for the risk assessment of
                   potential cavitation bioeffects.},

                   investigations have not solved the problem of the
                   microbubble oscillation. A simple in-vitro system
                   based on a commercial scanner (ATL UM9) was used to
                   insonate (3 MHz transmission) diluted contrast
                   suspensions of Definity and Quantison at different
                   acoustic pressures (0.27-1.52 MPa). The experimental
                   data were referred to a blood mimicking fluid in
                   order to extract an estimate of their scattering
                   cross-section. The results were compared with the
                   solutions of the three main bubble oscillatidn
                   models, Rayleigh-Plesset, Herring and Gilmore.
                   Non-linear solutions of the above models were
                   produced numerically using the Mathematica Package
                   Software. The experiments showed that both agents
                   provided a linear increase in scattering
                   cross-section with increasing acoustic pressure. The
                   thick shelled Quantison provided an increasing number
                   of scatterers with increasing acoustic pressure,
                   which proved that free bubbles leaked out of the
                   shell. At high acoustic pressures both Quantison and
                   Definity scattering cross-sections were almost
                   identical, and were probably that of a free bubble.
                   The Rayleigh-Plesset model provided a scattering
                   cross-section almost independent of acoustic
                   pressure. On the contrary the scattering
                   cross-sections calculated by the Herring and Gilmore
                   models solutions displayed a definite dependence on
                   acoustic pressure of an order higher than one, which
                   is slightly higher than the order of dependence
                   exhibited by the experimental data. However, the
                   increase of the experimentally measured scattering
                   cross-section with acoustic pressure was sharper than
                   the calculated one by the above two models. This is
                   most probably due to the fact that the models
                   simulated damped and not free bubble oscillations. In
                   conclusion the Rayleigh-Plesset model was inadequate
                   in describing the bubble oscillations even at small
                   diagnostic acoustic pressures. The Herring and
                   Gilmore models could simulate the dependence of the
                   scattering cross-section of encapsulated microbubbles
                   on acoustic pressure. However the contribution of
                   free bubble oscillations has still to be modelled.},

                   background echogenicity; and k, decay constant). By
                   analyzing the decay constants statistically, a
                   pressure threshold for Optison destruction due to
                   acoustically driven diffusion was identified.
                   Results. The decay constants determined from
                   quantified 3.5-MHz radio frequency data and B-mode
                   images were in good agreement. The peak rarefactional
                   pressure threshold for Optison destruction due to
                   acoustically driven diffusion at 3.5 MHz was 0.15 MPa
                   (MI = 0.08). Furthermore, the rate of Optison
                   destruction increased with increasing 3.5-MHz
                   exposure pressure output. Conclusions. Optison
                   destruction was quantified with a
                   laboratory-assembled 3.5-MHz ultrasound system and a
                   clinical diagnostic ultrasound scanner. The pressure
                   threshold for acoustically driven diffusion was
                   identified, and 3 distinct mechanisms of ultrasound
                   contrast agent destruction were observed with
                   acoustic techniques.},

                   gastrocnemius muscles, supraspinatus and Achilles

                   prostate tissue samples subject to compression
                   loading has been investigated. A model for the
                   loading was validated and used to guide the
                   experimental design for data collection. The model
                   allowed the use of small samples that could be
                   considered homogeneous; this assumption was confirmed
                   by histological analysis. The samples were tested at
                   three strain rates to evaluate the viscoelastic
                   nature of the material and determine the validity of
                   modeling the tissue as an elastic material for the
                   strain rates of interest. For loading frequencies
                   above 1 Hz, the storage modulus accounted for over 93
                   percent of the complex modulus. The data show that
                   breast fat tissue has a constant modulus over the
                   strain range tested while the other tissues have a
                   modulus that is dependent on the strain level. The
                   fibrous tissue samples from the breast were found to
                   be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stiffer than fat
                   tissue. Normal glandular breast tissue was found to
                   have an elastic modulus similar to that of fat at low
                   strain levels, but the modulus of the glandular
                   tissue increased by an order of magnitude above fat
                   at high strain levels. Carcinomas from the breast
                   were stiffer than the other tissues at the higher
                   strain level; intraductal in situ carcinomas were
                   like fat at the low strain level and much stiffer
                   than glandular tissue at the high strain level.
                   Infiltrating ductal carcinomas were much stiffer than
                   any of the other breast tissues. Normal prostate
                   tissue has a modulus that is lower than the modulus
                   of the prostate cancers tested. Tissue from prostate
                   with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) had modulus
                   values significantly lower than normal tissue. There
                   was a constant but not significant difference in the
                   modulus of tissues taken from the anterior and
                   posterior portions of the gland.},

                   scheme is used to simulate the collapse of a gas
                   bubble in water. In order to better understand the
                   damage caused by collapsing bubbles, the dynamics of
                   the shock-induced and Rayleigh collapse of a bubble
                   near a planar rigid surface and in a free field are
                   analysed. Collapse times, bubble displacements,
                   interfacial velocities and surface pressures are
                   quantified as a function of the pressure ratio
                   driving the collapse and of the initial bubble
                   stand-off distance from the wall; these quantities
                   are compared to the available theory and experiments
                   and show good agreement with the data for both the
                   bubble dynamics and the propagation of the shock
                   emitted upon the collapse. Non-spherical collapse
                   involves the formation of a re-entrant jet directed
                   towards the wall or in the direction of propagation
                   of the incoming shock. In shock-induced collapse,
                   very high jet velocities can be achieved, and the
                   finite time for shock propagation through the bubble
                   may be non-negligible compared to the collapse time
                   for the pressure ratios of interest. Several types of
                   shock waves are generated during the collapse,
                   including precursor and water-hammer shocks that
                   arise from the re-entrant jet formation and its
                   impact upon the distal side of the bubble,
                   respectively. The water-hammer shock can generate
                   very high pressures on the wall, far exceeding those
                   from the incident shock. The potential damage to the
                   neighbouring surface is quantified by measuring the
                   wall pressure. The range of stand-off distances and

                   greater understanding about species dependency. A
                   total of 99 76 ?? 7.6-d-old 2.4 ?? 0.14-kg New
                   Zealand White rabbits were used. Exposure conditions
                   were 5.6-MHz, 10-s exposure duration, 1-kHz PRF and
                   1.1-??s pulse duration. The in situ (at the pleural
                   surface) peak rarefactional pressure, pr(in situ),
                   ranged between 1.5 and 8.4 MPa, with nine acoustic US
                   exposure groups plus a sham exposure group. Rabbits
                   were assigned randomly to the 10 groups, each with 10
                   rabbits, except for one group that had nine rabbits.
                   Rabbits were exposed bilaterally with the order of
                   exposure (left then right lung, or right then left
                   lung) and acoustic pressure both randomized.
                   Individuals involved in animal handling, exposure and
                   lesion scoring were blinded to the exposure
                   condition. Probit regression analysis was used to
                   examine the dependence of the lesion occurrence on in
                   situ peak rarefactional pressure and order of
                   exposure (first vs. second). Likewise, lesion depth
                   and lesion root surface area were analyzed using
                   Gaussian tobit regression analysis. Neither
                   probability of a lesion nor lesion size measurements
                   was found to be statistically dependent on the order
                   of exposure after the effect of pr(in situ) was
                   considered. Also, a significant correlation was not
                   detected between the two exposed lung sides on the
                   same rabbit in either lesion occurrence or size
                   measures. The pr(in situ) threshold estimates (in
                   MPa) were similar to each other across occurrence
                   (3.54 ?? 0.78), depth (3.36 ?? 0.73) and surface area
                   (3.43 ?? 0.77) of lesions. Using the same
                   experimental techniques and statistical approach,
                   great consistency of thresholds was demonstrated
                   across three species (mouse, rat and rabbit).
                   Further, there were no differences in the biologic
                   mechanism of injury induced by US and US-induced
                   lesions were similar in morphology in all species and

                   considering the potential flow equations near the
                   bubble tips. The model is applied to
                   two‐dimensional single‐mode evolution as well as
                   two‐bubble competition, for both the
                   Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) and the Richtmyer–Meshkov
                   (RM) instabilities, the latter treated in an impulse
                   approximation. The model predicts that the asymptotic
                   velocity of a single‐mode RM bubble of wavelength

                   phenomena such as freeze‐out, interface coupling,
                   and feedthrough, several new configurations are
                   simulated on a two‐dimensional hydrocode. The basic
                   system is an A/B/A combination, where A is air and B
                   is a finite‐thickness layer of freon, SF6, or
                   helium. The middle layer B has perturbations either
                   on its upstream or downstream side, or on both sides,
                   in which case the perturbations may be in phase
                   (sinuous) or out of phase (varicose). The evolution

                   haemorrhage was investigated in 150 mice and 150 rats
                   at 2.8 MHz to assess the role of pulse repetition
                   frequency (PRF) and exposure duration (ED). Each
                   species was divided into 15 exposure groups (10 per
                   group) for a 3{\&}times;5 randomized factorial design
                   (3 EDs of 5, 10 and 20 s; and 5 PRFs of 25, 50, 100,
                   250 and 500 Hz). The in situ peak rarefactional
                   pressure (12.3 MPa) and pulse duration (1.42
                   {\&}mu;s) were the same for all ultrasonically
                   exposed animals. Also, for both species, 15
                   sham-exposed animals were randomized into both
                   studies, none of which had lesions. Factorial
                   analysis of variance was used to evaluate effects of
                   PRF and ED on the proportion of lesions, lesion depth
                   and lesion surface area. The proportion of lesions in
                   both species was related statistically to PRF and ED,
                   with the exception that PRF in rats was not quite
                   significant. The PRF, but not ED, significantly
                   affected lesion depth in both species. Both PRF and
                   ED significantly affected lesion surface area in
                   mice, while neither affected area in rats. The
                   PRF{\&}times;ED interaction (number of pulses) for
                   these measures was not significant for either
                   species. Species significantly affected lesion
                   production and size; there were fewer lesions in
                   mice, and the lesion size was greater in rats. The
                   characteristics of the lesions produced in both

                   wall thickness (CWT) suggest that standard-length
                   angiocatheters (4.5 cm) may fail to decompress
                   tension pneumothoraces. We used an alternative
                   modality, ultrasound, to measure CWT. We correlated
                   CWT with body mass index (BMI) and used national data
                   to estimate the percentage of patients with CWT
                   greater than 4.5 cm. METHODS This was an
                   observational, cross-sectional study of a convenience
                   sample. We recorded standing height, weight, and sex.
                   We measured CWT with ultrasound at the second
                   intercostal space, midclavicular line and at the
                   fourth intercostal space, midaxillary line on supine
                   subjects. We correlated BMI (weight [in
                   kilograms]/height(2) [in square meters]) with CWT
                   using linear regression. 95{\%} Confidence intervals
                   (CIs) assessed statistical significance. National
                   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey results for
                   2007-2008 were combined to estimate national BMI
                   adult measurements. RESULTS Of 51 subjects, 33
                   (65{\%}) were male and 18 (35{\%}) were female. Mean
                   anterior CWT (male, 2.1 cm; CI, 1.9-2.3; female, 2.3
                   cm; CI, 1.7-2.7), lateral CWT (male, 2.4 cm; CI,
                   2.1-2.6; female, 2.5 cm; CI 2.0-2.9), and BMI (male,
                   27.7; CI, 26.1-29.3; female, 30.0; CI, 25.8-34.2) did
                   not differ by sex. Lateral CWT was greater than
                   anterior CWT (0.2 cm; CI, 0.1-0.4; P {\textless}
                   .01). Only one subject with a BMI of 48.2 had a CWT
                   that exceeded 4.5 cm. Using national BMI estimates,
                   less than 1{\%} of the US population would be
                   expected to have CWT greater than 4.5 cm. CONCLUSIONS
                   Ultrasound measurements suggest that most patients
                   will have CWT less than 4.5 cm and that CWT may not
                   be the source of the high failure rate of needle
                   decompression in tension pneumothorax.},

  abstract =      {Recent studies indicated that lung tissue stress
                   relaxation is well represented by a simple empirical
                   equation involving a power law, t-beta (where t is
                   time). Likewise, tissue impedance is well described
                   by a model having a frequency-independent (constant)
                   phase with impedance proportional to omega-alpha
                   (where omega is angular frequency and alpha is a
                   constant). These models provide superior descriptions
                   over conventional spring-dashpot systems. Here we
                   offer a mathematical framework and explore its
                   mechanistic basis for using the power law relaxation
                   function and constant-phase impedance. We show that
                   replacing ordinary time derivatives with fractional
                   time derivatives in the constitutive equation of
                   conventional spring-dashpot systems naturally leads
                   to power law relaxation function, the Fourier
                   transform of which is the constant-phase impedance
                   with alpha = 1 - beta. We further establish that
                   fractional derivatives have a mechanistic basis with
                   respect to the viscoelasticity of certain polymer
                   systems. This mechanistic basis arises from molecular
                   theories that take into account the complexity and
                   statistical nature of the system at the molecular
                   level. Moreover, because tissues are composed of long
                   flexible biopolymers, we argue that these molecular
                   theories may also apply for soft tissues. In our
                   approach a key parameter is the exponent beta, which
                   is shown to be directly related to dynamic processes
                   at the tissue fiber and matrix level. By exploring
                   statistical properties of various polymer systems, we
                   offer a molecular basis for several salient features
                   of the dynamic passive mechanical properties of soft
                   tissues.},

  ) that estimated pressure thresholds as a function of pulse duration (PD:
  1.3, 4.4, 8.2, and 11.6 {\{}micro{\}}s; 2.8 MHz; 10-s exposure duration [ED];
  1-kHz pulse repetition frequency [PRF]). In this study, the roles of PRF and
  PD were evaluated at 5.9 MPa, the peak rarefactional pressure threshold near
  that of the ED50 estimate previously determined. Methods. A 4 x 4 factorial
  design study (PRF: 50, 170, 500, and 1700 Hz; PD: 1.3, 4.4, 8.2, and 11.6
  {\{}micro{\}}s) was conducted (2.8 MHz; 10-s ED). Sprague Dawley rats (n =
  175) were divided into 16 exposure groups (10 rats per group) and 1 sham
  group (15 rats); no lesions were produced in the sham group. Logistic
  regression analysis evaluated significance of effects for lesion occurrence,
  and Gaussian tobit analysis evaluated significance for lesion depth and
  surface area. Results. For lesion occurrence and sizes, the main effect of
  PRF was not significant. The interaction term, PRF x PD, was highly
  significant, indicating a strong positive dependence of lesion occurrence on
  the duty factor. The main effect of PD was almost significant (P = .052) and
  thus was included in the analysis model for a better fit. Conclusions.
  Compared with the findings from a PRF x ED factorial study ( J Ultrasound Med
  2005; 24:339-348 ), a function that considers PRF, PD, and ED might yield a
  sensitive indicator for consideration of a modified mechanical index, at
  least for the lung.},

                   The results are interpreted using the implicit
                   numerical dissipation in the characteristic
                   projection-based, finite-difference WENO method. It
                   is shown that higher-order higher-resolution
                   simulations have lower numerical dissipation. The
                   sensitivity of the quantities considered to the order
                   and resolution is further amplified following
                   reshock, when the energy deposition by the second
                   shock-interface interaction induces the formation of
                   small-scale structures. Lower-order lower-resolution
                   simulations preserve large-scale structures and flow
                   symmetry to late times, while higher-order
                   higher-resolution simulations exhibit fragmentation
                   of the structures, symmetry breaking and increased
                   mixing. Similar flow features are qualitatively and
                   quantitatively captured by either approximately
                   doubling the order or the resolution. Additionally,
                   the computational scaling shows that increasing the
                   order is more advantageous than increasing the
                   resolution for the flow considered here. The present

                   seen widespread use for compressible flow problems in
                   a single fluid with constant material properties, it
                   has yet to be implemented in a consistent fashion for
                   compressible multiphase flows with shocks and
                   interfaces. Specifically, it is challenging to design
                   a scheme that meets the following requirements:
                   conservation, high-order accuracy in smooth regions
                   and non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities (in
                   particular, material interfaces). Following the
                   interface-capturing approach of Abgrall [1], we model
                   flows of multiple fluid components or phases using a
                   single equation of state with variable material
                   properties; discontinuities in these properties
                   correspond to interfaces. To represent compressible
                   phenomena in solids, liquids, and gases, we present
                   our analysis for equations of state belonging to the
                   Mie–Gr{\"{u}}neisen family. Within the dg
                   framework, we propose a conservative, high-order
                   accurate, and non-oscillatory limiting procedure,
                   verified with simple multifluid and multiphase
                   problems. We show analytically that two key elements
                   are required to prevent spurious pressure
                   oscillations at interfaces and maintain conservation:
                   (i) the transport equation(s) describing the material
                   properties must be solved in a non-conservative weak
                   form, and (ii) the suitable variables must be limited
                   (density, momentum, pressure, and appropriate
                   properties entering the equation of state), coupled
                   with a consistent reconstruction of the energy.
                   Further, we introduce a physics-based discontinuity
                   sensor to apply limiting in a solution-adaptive
                   fashion. We verify this approach with one- and
                   two-dimensional problems with shocks and interfaces,
                   including high pressure and density ratios, for
                   fluids obeying different equations of state to
                   illustrate the robustness and versatility of the
                   method. The algorithm is implemented on parallel
                   graphics processing units (gpu) to achieve high
                   speedup.},

  abstract =      {OBJECTIVE: Lung ultrasound is increasingly used in
                   the critically ill adult. It allows prompt management
                   based upon reproducible data and generates fewer
                   computed tomography (CT) examinations, therefore
                   decreasing irradiation, delays, cost, and discomfort
                   to the patient. The aim of this article is to
                   describe the value of ultrasound for lung imaging in
                   the critically ill and state our experience in
                   neonates. METHODS: Review of studies published in the
                   peer-reviewed international literature analyzing
                   consecutive critically ill adults admitted to
                   intensive care units, assessing pleural effusion,
                   alveolar consolidation, interstitial syndrome, and
                   pneumothorax, using a standardized ultrasound
                   approach to the lung, with CT as the reference. DATA
                   SYNTHESIS: The sensitivity and specificity of
                   ultrasound are 92{\%} and 93{\%} for pleural
                   effusion, 90{\%} and 98{\%} for alveolar
                   consolidation, 93{\%} and 93{\%} for interstitial
                   syndrome, 100{\%} and 96{\%} for complete
                   pneumothorax, 79{\%} and 100{\%} for radio-occult
                   pneumothorax. DISCUSSION: This article reviews data
                   that validate the scientific value of lung ultrasound
                   in adult medical intensive care units. We then
                   present observations in the critically ill neonate.
                   The discussion points to the methodologic issues
                   raised in lung ultrasound in the neonate, i.e. mainly
                   the limited access to a pertinent gold standard (CT).
                   Some CT correlations are presented, confirming the
                   value of lung ultrasound in the neonate. CONCLUSIONS:
                   The standardized signs assessed in the adult are also
                   found in the critically ill neonate, meaning a
                   potential use in this field. Awaiting confirmatory CT
                   studies, lung ultrasound can be taken into
                   consideration as a possible bedside tool for
                   completing bedside radiography.},

  year =          {1991},
  abstract =      {In the mammalian lung, alveolar gas and blood are
                   separated by an extremely thin membrane, despite the
                   fact that mechanical failure could be catastrophic
                   for gas exchange. We raised the pulmonary capillary
                   pressure in anesthetized rabbits until stress failure
                   occurred. At capillary transmural pressures greater
                   than or equal to 40 mmHg, disruption of the capillary
                   endothelium and alveolar epithelium was seen in some
                   locations. The three principal forces acting on the
                   capillary wall were analyzed. 1) Circumferential wall
                   tension caused by the transmural pressure. This is
                   approximately 25 dyn/cm (25 mN/m) at failure where
                   the radius of curvature of the capillary is 5
                   microns. This tension is small, being comparable with
                   the tension in the alveolar wall associated with lung
                   elastic recoil. 2) Surface tension of the alveolar
                   lining layer. This contributes support to the
                   capillaries that bulge into the alveolar spaces at
                   these high pressures. When protein leakage into the
                   alveolar spaces occurs because of stress failure, the
                   increase in surface tension caused by surfactant
                   inhibition could be a powerful force preventing
                   further failure. 3) Tension of the tissue elements in
                   the alveolar wall associated with lung inflation.
                   This may be negligible at normal lung volumes but
                   considerable at high volumes. Whereas circumferential
                   wall tension is low, capillary wall stress at failure
                   is very high at approximately 8 x 10(5) dyn/cm2 (8 x
                   10(4) N/m2) where the thickness is only 0.3 microns.
                   This is approximately the same as the wall stress of
                   the normal aorta, which is predominantly composed of
                   collagen and elastin. The strength of the thin part
                   of the capillary wall is probably attributable to the
                   collagen IV of the basement membranes. The safety
                   factor is apparently small when the capillary
                   pressure is raised during heavy exercise. Stress
                   failure causes increased permeability with protein
                   leakage, or frank hemorrhage, and probably has a role
                   in several types of lung disease.},

                   mechanisms and species differences associated with
                   ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage. In a series of
                   three sequential interdependent studies, 312 mice, 91
                   rabbits, and 74 pigs were divided at random into
                   experimental groups and exposed to continuous-wave
                   ultrasound (3 kHz modulated at 120 Hz) of acoustic
                   pressure levels ranging from 0 to 490 kPa for 5, 10,
                   or 20 minutes. In a fourth study, three mice, 43
                   rabbits, and six pigs were divided at random into
                   experimental groups and exposed to pulsed-wave

                   rarefactional acoustic pressure levels ranging from 0
                   to 5.6 MPa for 5 minutes. Macroscopic lesions induced
                   by continuous- and pulsed-wave ultrasound consisted
                   of dark red to black areas of hemorrhage that
                   extended from visceral pleural surfaces into lung
                   parenchyma. Hemorrhage appeared spatially related to
                   the edges of lung lobes where pleura of dorsal and
                   ventral surfaces met, occurred in specific lung lobes
                   in all three species, and appeared anatomically
                   related to lung that was closest to and in contiguous
                   alignment with the ultrasound transducer and thus the
                   path of the sound beam. Macroscopic lesions were
                   similar in all species under all exposure conditions
                   for both continuous- and pulsed-wave ultrasound;
                   however, hemorrhage was not induced in pig lung
                   exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound at any peak
                   rarefactional acoustic pressure level. Eighteen mice
                   (145 kPa exposure pressure), 60 rabbits (145-460 kPa
                   exposure pressure), and 58 pigs (145-490 kPa exposure
                   pressure) from study 3 were used for microscopic
                   evaluation of lung exposed to continuous-wave
                   ultrasound; three mice (6 MHz; 2.9 and 5.4 MPa), 39
                   rabbits (3 and 6 MHz; 2.3-5.4 MPa), and six pigs (3
                   and 6 MHz; 3.3, 5.4, and 5.6 MPa) from study 4 were
                   used for microscopic evaluation of lung exposed to
                   pulsed-wave ultrasound. Microscopic lesions and the
                   character of hemorrhage induced by continuous-wave
                   ultrasound were different from those induced by
                   pulsed-wave ultrasound. Lesions induced by
                   continuous-wave ultrasound under all exposure
                   conditions were similar in all three species. Lesions

  abstract =      {It is well documented that ultrasound-induced lung
                   hemorrhage can occur in mice, rats, rabbits, pigs,
                   and monkeys. The objective of this study was to
                   assess the role of the ultrasound beamwidth (beam
                   diameter incident on the lung surface) on lesion
                   threshold and size. A total of 144 rats were randomly
                   exposed to pulsed ultrasound at three exposure levels
                   and four beamwidths (12 rats per group). The three in
                   situ peak rarefactional pressures were about 5, 7.5,
                   and 10 MPa. The four 19-mm-diameter focused
                   transducers had measured pulse-echo -6-dB focal
                   beamwidths of 470 $\mu$m (2.8 MHz; f/1), 930 $\mu$m
                   (2.8 MHz; f/2), 310 $\mu$m (5.6 MHz; f/1), and 510
                   $\mu$m (5.6 MHz; f/2). Exposure durations were 10 s,
                   pulse repetition frequencies were 1 kHz, and pulse
                   durations were 1.3 $\mu$s (2.8 MHz; f/1), 1.2 $\mu$s
                   (2.8 MHz; f/2), 0.8 $\mu$s (5.6 MHz; f/1) and 1.1
                   $\mu$s (5.6 MHz; f/2). The lesion surface area and
                   depth were measured for each rat as well as the
                   percentage of rats with lesions per group. Logistic
                   regression analysis and Gaussian-Tobit analysis
                   methods were used to analyze the data. The effects of
                   in situ peak rarefactional pressure and beamwidth
                   were highly significant, but ultrasonic frequency was
                   not significant. In addition, the estimated
                   interaction between in situ peak rarefactional
                   pressure and beamwidth was positive and highly
                   significant. The ultrasound beamwidth incident on the
                   lung surface was shown to strongly affect the
                   percentage and size of ultrasound-induced lung
                   hemorrhage lesions. Even though ultrasonic frequency
                   was an experimental variable, it was not shown to
                   affect the lesion percentage or size.},

                   250-g female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) were
                   randomly divided into 20 ultrasonic exposure groups
                   (10 rats/group) and one sham group (20 rats). The 20
                   ultrasonic exposure groups (2.8-MHz; 10-s exposure
                   duration; 1-kHz PRF; -6-dB pulse-echo focal beam
                   width of 470 ??m) were divided into four PD groups
                   (1.3, 4.4, 8.2 and 11.6 ??s) and, for each PD group,
                   there were five in situ peak rarefactional pressures
                   (range between 4 and 9 MPa). Rats were weighed,
                   anesthetized, depilated, exposed, and euthanized
                   under anesthesia. The left lung was removed and
                   scored for the occurrence of hemorrhage. If
                   hemorrhage was present, the lesion surface area and
                   depth were measured. Individuals involved in animal
                   handling, exposure and lesion scoring were "blinded"
                   to the exposure conditions. Logistic regression
                   analysis was used to examine the dependence of the
                   lesion occurrences, and Gaussian tobit regression
                   analysis was used to examine the dependence of the
                   lesion surface areas and depths on in situ peak
                   rarefactional pressure and PD. Threshold results are
                   reported in terms of ED05. For PDs of 1.3, 4.4, 8.2
                   and 11.6 ??s, respectively, lesion occurrence ED05s
                   were 3.1, 2.8, 2.3 and 2.0 MPa with standard errors
                   around 0.6 MPa. Lesion size ED 05s showed similar
                   values. A mechanical index (MI) of 1.9, the US Food
                   and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory limit of
                   diagnostic US equipment, is equivalent to the adult
                   rat's in situ peak rarefactional pressure of 4.0 MPa.
                   PDs of 8.2 and 11.6 ??s had ED05s more than 2
                   standard errors below 4.0 MPa, indicating that the
                   ED05s of these two PDs are statistically
                   significantly different from 4.0 MPa. The ED05
                   threshold levels for a PD of 1.3 ??s are consistent
                   with previous US-induced lung hemorrhage studies. As
                   the PD increases, the ED05 levels decrease,
                   suggesting greater likelihood of lung damage as the
                   PD increases. All of the ED05s are less than the FDA
                   limit. ?? 2003 World Federation for Ultrasound in

                   (10-$\mu$s pulse and a carrier frequency of 2 MHz).
                   This investigation used neonatal swine to determine
                   if the findings for mice can be generalized to other
                   species. After exploratory observations, the inverse
                   sampling method was used in a primary study (22
                   animals, 88 exposure sites) to determine the
                   threshold for lung hemorrhage in neonatal swine. The
                   primary study was followed by a separate confirmation
                   study (13 animals, 48 exposure sites), testing the

                   at subthreshold levels with sham-exposed animals. A
                   separate investigation explored the histological

                   2.3-MHz focused transducer (10 $\mu$s at 100-Hz
                   pulse-repetition frequency) was incremented
                   vertically for a distance of 2 cm over the chest of

                   determined for a pulse duration of 10 $\mu$s at 10°C
                   and exposure durations of 2.4 and 180 s. The results
                   show that the threshold exposure conditions for lung
                   hemorrhage are much less than the conditions for
                   cavitational or other effects reported for tissues
                   that do not contain well defined gas bodies. In
                   addition, the results show an inverse relation
                   between exposure level and either exposure duration
                   or sound on-time, suggesting that time is an
                   important parameter associated with bubble effects.},

                   lung hemorrhage by examining the effect of pulse
                   polarity at a common in situ (at the lung surface)
                   peak rarefactional pressure [p r(in situ) ] and at a
                   common in situ pulse intensity integral ( PII in situ
                   ). A total of 60 rats was divided into three
                   experimental groups of 20 animals per group and
                   randomly exposed to pulsed ultrasound. The groups
                   were exposed as follows: Group 1 to 0° polarity
                   pulses (compression followed by rarefraction) at a p
                   r(in situ) of 3.48 MPa and a PII in situ of 4.78
                   Ws/m2, group 2 to 180° polarity pulses (rarefraction
                   followed by compression) at a p r(in situ) of 3.72
                   MPa and a PII in situ of 2.55 Ws/m2, and group 3 to
                   180° polarity pulses at a p r(in situ) of 4.97 MPa
                   and a PII in situ of 4.79 Ws/m2. For all experimental
                   groups, the frequency was 2.46 MHz, the exposure
                   duration was 240 s, the pulse repetition frequency
                   was 2.5 kHz, and the pulse duration was 0.42 $\mu$s.
                   Six sham animals were also randomly distributed among
                   the experimental animals. The lesion surface area and
                   depth were determined for each rat as well as lesion
                   occurrence (percentage of rats with lesions) per
                   group. It was found that lesion occurrence and size
                   correlated better with PII in situ than with p r(in
                   situ) , suggesting that a mechanism other than
                   inertial cavitation was responsible for the damage.},

                   exposed to pulsed ultrasound using superthreshold
                   exposure conditions known to produce significant lung
                   hemorrhage. METHODS: In 1 group of 9 anesthetized
                   Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 foci of ultrasound-induced
                   hemorrhage were produced in the left lung of each
                   rat. In a second group of 6 rats, 5 foci of
                   ultrasound-induced hemorrhage were produced in the
                   left and right lungs of each rat. Each lesion was
                   induced using superthreshold pulsed ultrasound
                   exposure conditions (3.1-MHz center frequency,
                   1.7-kHz pulse repetition frequency, 1.3-micro-second
                   pulse duration, 60-second exposure duration, 39-MPa
                   in situ peak compressional pressure, and 17-MPa in
                   situ peak rarefactional pressure). After exposure,
                   the lungs were fixed in formalin and assessed
                   histologically. The total lesion volume was
                   calculated for each lesion in each lung lobe.
                   Measurements of cardiopulmonary function included
                   assessment of pulsatile arterial pressure, heart
                   rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide, respiratory rate, and
                   arterial blood gases (PCO2 and PO2). Functional data
                   were quantified before (baseline) and 30 minutes
                   after exposure to ultrasound. RESULTS: In the 9 rats
                   that had lesions in only the left lung, the mean
                   (SEM) lesion volume was 97 (13) mm3 and represented
                   about 3.4{\%} of the total lung volume. In the 6 rats
                   that had lesions in both the left and right lungs,
                   the left, right, and total mean lesion volumes,
                   respectively, were 102 (16), 114 (11), and 216 (18)
                   mm3 and represented about 3.7{\%}, 4.2{\%}, and
                   7.9{\%} of the total lung volume. There were no
                   statistically significant differences in
                   cardiopulmonary measurements between baseline values
                   and values obtained after exposure to ultrasound in
                   the 9 rats exposed on the left lung only. The 6 rats
                   exposed bilaterally had statistically significant
                   differences in arterial pressure (134 +/- 4 versus
                   113 +/- 9 mm Hg; P= .047) and arterial PO2 (70 +/- 5
                   versus 58 +/- 4 mm Hg; P = .024) between baseline
                   values and values obtained after exposure to
                   ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of
                   ultrasound-induced lesions produced in 1 lung did not
                   affect measurements of cardiopulmonary function
                   because of the functional respiratory reserve in the
                   unexposed lung. However, when both the left and right
                   lungs had ultrasound-induced lesions, the functional
                   respiratory reserve was decreased to a point at which
                   rats were unable to maintain systemic arterial
                   pressure or resting levels of arterial PO2.},

                   MPa) than middle-aged pigs (5.83 /spl plusmn/ 0.52
                   MPa). The oldest pigs also had a lower threshold than
                   neonate pigs (3.60 /spl plusmn/ 0.44 MPa). Also, an
                   unexpected result was observed. The ultrasound
                   exposures were bilateral, and the threshold results
                   reported above were based on the lung that was first
                   exposed. After the first lung was exposed, the pig
                   was turned ove- - r and the other lung was exposed to
                   the same acoustic pressure. There was a significant
                   decrease (greater than the confidence limits) in
                   occurrence thresholds: 3.60 to 2.68, 5.83 to 2.97,

                   exposed. Thus, a subtle effect in lung physiology
                   resulted in a major effect on lesion thresholds.},

                   the role of pulse repetition frequency (PRF: 25, 50,

                   situ). Methods. Sprague Dawley rats (n = 198) were
                   divided into 18 ultrasonically exposed groups (10
                   rats per group) and 6 sham groups (3 per group). The
                   3 × 3 factorial design study (PRF: 17, 170, and 1700
                   Hz; ED: 5, 31.6, and 200 s) was conducted at 2
                   frequencies (2.8 and 5.6 MHz). The p r(in situ) was
                   6.1 MPa. Logistic regression analysis evaluated
                   lesion occurrence, and Gaussian tobit analysis
                   evaluated lesion depth and surface area. Results.
                   Frequency did not have a significant effect, so the
                   analysis combined results for the 2 frequencies. For
                   lesion occurrence and sizes, the main effects for PRF
                   and ED were not significant. The interaction term was
                   highly significant, indicating a strong dependence of
                   lesion occurrence and size on the total number of
                   pulses (PRF × ED). Conclusions. The results of both
                   studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the
                   total number of pulses is an important factor in the
                   genesis of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage.

                   Sprague-Dawley rats were each divided into 15
                   exposure groups (10 animals per group) for a 3 × 5
                   factorial design (3 exposure durations of 5, 10, and
                   20 s and 5 pulse repetition frequencies of 25, 50,
                   100, 250, and 500 Hz). The in situ (at the pleural
                   surface) peak rarefactional pressure of 12.3 MPa and
                   the pulse duration of 1.42 $\mu$s were the same for
                   all ultrasonically-exposed animals. In addition, 15
                   sham exposed mice and 15 sham exposed rats were
                   included into both studies. In each study of 165
                   animals, the exposure conditions were randomized. The
                   lesion depth and surface area were measured for each
                   animal, as well as the percentage of animals with
                   lesions per group. The characteristics of the lesions
                   produced in mice and rats were similar to those
                   described in studies by our research group and
                   others, suggesting a common pathogenesis for the
                   initiation and propagation of the lesions at the
                   gross and microscopic levels. The proportion of
                   lesions in both species was related statistically to
                   pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and exposure
                   duration (ED), with the exception that PRF in rats
                   was not quite significant; the PRF × ED interaction
                   (number of pulses) for lesion production was not

                   significantly affected lesion depth in both species;
                   the PRF × ED interaction for depth was not
                   significant for either species. Both PRF and ED
                   significantly affected lesion surface area in mice,
                   while neither affected area in rats; the PRF × ED

                   at two sites over the left lung to 3.1-MHz

                   lesions was evaluated from 0 through 44 days
                   postexposure. Macroscopic lesions at 0 days
                   postexposure were large bright red ellipses of
                   hemorrhage. By 1 and 3 days postexposure, lesions
                   were the same size and dark red to red-black, but, by
                   3 days postexposure, lesions had a raised surface
                   appearance. From 5 to 10 days postexposure, lesions
                   grew smaller in size, progressed from red-gray to
                   yellow-brown, and retained a raised surface
                   appearance. From 13 through 44 days postexposure,
                   lesions gradually decreased in size, had a faint
                   yellow-brown discoloration, and gradually lost the
                   raised surface appearance. By 37 and 44 days
                   postexposure, lung returned to near normal
                   morphology, but had small areas of light yellow-brown
                   discoloration in the areas where lung was exposed.
                   Microscopic lesions at 0 and 1 days postexposure were
                   areas of acute alveolar hemorrhage. By 3 days
                   postexposure, lesions had loss of alveolar
                   erythrocytes and the formation of hemoglobin
                   crystals. From 5 through 44 days postexposure, iron
                   in degraded erythrocytes was processed to hemosiderin
                   and was negligible in quantity at 44 days
                   postexposure. The proliferation of resident cells
                   (likely alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts and
                   endothelial cells) and the infiltration of
                   inflammatory cells in lesions declined in intensity
                   as the lesions aged and was minimal by 44 days
                   postexposure. Under the superthreshold exposure
                   conditions described, lesions induced by ultrasound
                   do not seem to have long-term residual effects in
                   lung. (E-mail: zacharyj@staff.uiuc.edu)},

                   function of species (adult mice and rats) and US
                   frequency (2.8 and 5.6 MHz). A total of 151
                   6-to-7-week-old female ICR mice and 160
                   10-to-11-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were
                   randomly divided into two US frequency groups, and
                   further randomly divided into seven or eight US peak
                   rarefactional pressure groups. Each group consisted
                   of about 10 animals. Animals were exposed to pulsed
                   US at either 2.8-MHz center frequency or 5.6-MHz
                   center frequency for a duration of 10 seconds. The in
                   situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional
                   pressure levels ranged between 2.5 and 10.5 MPa for
                   mice and between 2.3 and 11.3 MPa for rats. The
                   mechanical index (MI) ranged between 1.4 and 6.3 at
                   2.8 MHz for mice and between 1.1 and 3.1 at 5.6 MHz
                   for rats. The lesion surface area and depth were
                   measured for each animal as well as the percentage of
                   animals with lesions per group. The characteristics
                   of the lesions produced in mice and rats were similar
                   to those described in previous studies, suggesting a
                   common pathogenesis in the initiation and propagation
                   of the lesions at the gross and microscopic levels.
                   The percentage of animals with lesions showed no
                   statistical differences between species or between US
                   frequencies. These findings suggest that mice and
                   rats are similar in sensitivity to US-induced lung
                   damage and that the occurrence of lung damage is
                   independent of frequency. Lesion depth and surface
                   area also showed no statistically significant
                   differences between US frequencies for mice and rats.
                   However, there was a significant difference between
                   species for lesion area and a suggestive difference
                   between species for lesion depth. The superthreshold
                   behavior of lesion area and depth showed that rat
                   lung had more damage than mouse lung, and the
                   threshold estimates shelved a weak, or lack of,
                   frequency dependency, suggesting that the MI is not
                   consistent with the obser- - ved findings.},

                   ultrasonically induced lung hemorrhage in humans.
                   Multiple experimental laboratories have shown that
                   diagnostic ultrasound exposure can cause hemorrhage
                   in the lungs of laboratory animals. The left lung of
                   50 patients (6 women, 44 men, mean age 61 years) was
                   observed directly by the surgeon after routine
                   intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was
                   performed. From manufacturer specifications the
                   maximum derated intensity in the sound field of the
                   system used was 186 W/cm2, the maximum derated
                   rarefactional acoustic pressure was 2.4 MPa, and the
                   maximum mechanical index was 1.3. The lowest
                   frequency used was 3.5 MHz. This exposure exceeds the
                   threshold found for surface lung hemorrhage seen on
                   gross observation of laboratory animals. No
                   hemorrhage was noted on any lung surface by the
                   surgeon on gross observation. We conclude that
                   clinical transesophageal echocardiography, even at
                   field levels a little greater than the reported
                   thresholds for lung hemorrhage in laboratory animals,
                   did not cause surface lung hemorrhage apparent on
                   gross observation. These negative results support the
                   conclusion that the human lung is not markedly more
                   sensitive to ultrasound exposure than that of other
                   mammals. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 1998;11:57-60.)},

  abstract =      {It is customary to describe alveolar respiratory
                   mechanics in terms of a bubble-shaped model alveolus,
                   using the Laplace equation. The coexistence of
                   alveoli of different radii cannot be satisfactorily
                   explained by this model, even if hypotheses as yet
                   unconfirmed by experiment are taken into account.
                   Moreover, this model requires the assumption of
                   extremely low surface tensions, near 0 dny/cm, to
                   explain the absence of atelectasis with very small
                   alveolar radii and the maintenance of alveolar fluid
                   balance. On the basis of investigations of the
                   dynamic surface tension of lung alveolar surfactant
                   from rat lungs, however, the minimal surface tension
                   of alveoli is 18-20 dny/cm. In addition, the lung
                   does not consist of isolated and spherical alveoli
                   but a dense packing of polyhedral air spaces
                   separated by alveolar septa. This paper is an attempt
                   to analyze the recoil forces of the lung due to
                   surface tension on the basis of the polyhedral
                   alveolar structure and the minimum surface tension
                   mentioned above. It is demonstrated that several
                   geometrical parameters are able to guarantee the
                   stability of the alveolar structure of the lung to a
                   greater extent than a variable surface tension. It is
                   concluded that not a single (and fictive) alveolus
                   but the septal intersections and the "peripheral"
                   septa (limiting only one air space) are the smallest
                   morphological units of the respiratory mechanics.

                   linear elements, may distend due to inflation-induced
                   reduction in slack or increase in tissue stretch. The
                   distended septum supports tissue elastic and
                   interfacial forces. An effective Young's modulus,
                   describing the inflation-induced relative
                   displacement of septal end points, has not been
                   determined in situ for lack of a means of determining
                   the forces supported by septa in situ. Here we
                   determine such forces indirectly according to Mead,
                   Takishima, and Leith's classic lung mechanics
                   analysis (J Appl Physiol 28: 596-608, 1970), which
                   demonstrates that septal connections transmit the
                   transpulmonary pressure, PTP, from the pleural
                   surface to interior regions. We combine experimental
                   septal strain determination and computational stress
                   determination, according to Mead et al., to calculate
                   effective Young's modulus. In the isolated, perfused
                   rat lung, we label the perfusate with fluorescence to
                   visualize the alveolar septa. At eight PTP values
                   around a ventilation loop between 4 and 25 cmH2O, and
                   upon total deflation, we image the same region by
                   confocal microscopy. Within an analysis region, we
                   measure septal lengths. Normalizing by unstressed
                   lengths at total deflation, we calculate septal
                   strains for all PTP {\textgreater} 0 cmH2O. For the
                   static imaging conditions, we computationally model
                   application of PTP to the boundary of the analysis
                   region and solve for septal stresses by least squares
                   fit of an overdetermined system. From group septal
                   strain and stress values, we find effective septal
                   Young's modulus to range from 1.2 × 10(5) dyn/cm(2)
                   at low P(TP) to 1.4 × 10(6) dyn/cm(2) at high

                   bioengineering structure because of its vast area but
                   extreme thinness. Despite this, almost no attention
                   has been given to its mechanical properties. The
                   remarkable area and thinness come about because gas
                   exchange occurs by passive diffusion. However, the
                   barrier also needs to be immensely strong to
                   withstand the very high stresses in the capillary
                   wall when capillary pressure rises during exercise.
                   The strength of the thin region of the barrier comes
                   from type IV collagen in the basement membranes. When
                   the stresses in the capillary walls rise to high
                   levels, ultrastructural changes occur in the barrier,
                   a condition known as stress failure. Physiological
                   conditions that alter the properties of the barrier
                   include severe exercise in elite human athletes.
                   Animals that have been selectively bred for high
                   aerobic activity, such as Thoroughbred racehorses,
                   consistently break their pulmonary capillaries during
                   galloping. Pathophysiological conditions causing
                   stress failure include high-altitude pulmonary edema
                   and overinflation of the lung, which frequently
                   occurs with mechanical ventilation. Remodeling of the
                   capillary wall occurs in response to increased wall
                   stress in diseases such as mitral stenosis. The
                   barrier is able to maintain its extreme thickness
                   with sufficient strength as a result of continual
                   regulation of its wall structure. How it does this is
                   a central problem in lung biology.},

  abstract =      {In a variety of recently developed medical
                   procedures, bubbles are formed directly in soft
                   tissue and may cause damage. While cavitation in
                   Newtonian liquids has received significant attention,
                   bubble dynamics in tissue, a viscoelastic medium,
                   remains poorly understood. To model tissue, most
                   previous studies have focused on Maxwell-based
                   viscoelastic fluids. However, soft tissue generally
                   possesses an original configuration to which it
                   relaxes after deformation. Thus, a Kelvin-Voigt-based
                   viscoelastic model is expected to be a more
                   appropriate representation. Furthermore, large
                   oscillations may occur, thus violating the
                   infinitesimal strain assumption and requiring a
                   nonlinear/finite-strain elasticity description. In
                   this article, we develop a theoretical framework to
                   simulate spherical bubble dynamics in a viscoelastic
                   medium with nonlinear elasticity. Following modern
                   continuum mechanics formalism, we derive the form of
                   the elastic forces acting on a bubble for common
                   strain-energy functions (e.g. neo-Hookean,
                   Mooney-Rivlin) and incorporate them into
                   Rayleigh-Plesset-like equations. The main effects of
                   nonlinear elasticity are to reduce the violence of
                   the collapse and rebound for large departures from
                   the equilibrium radius, and increase the oscillation
                   frequency. The present approach can readily be
                   extended to other strain-energy functions and used to
                   compute the stress/deformation fields in the
                   surrounding medium.},

                   the relative importance of thermally vs mechanically
                   induced damage is unclear. As a first step to
                   investigate this matter, a numerical model for bubble
                   dynamics in tissue-like, viscoelastic media is
                   presented in which full thermal effects are included
                   inside and outside the bubble, as well as
                   interdiffusion of vapor and non-condensible gas
                   inside the bubble. Soft tissue is assumed to behave
                   according to a Kelvin-Voigt model in which viscous
                   and elastic contributions are additive. A neo-Hookean
                   formulation, appropriate for finite-strain
                   elasticity, accounts for the large deformations
                   produced by cavitation. Numerical solutions to
                   problems of relevance to therapeutic ultrasound are
                   examined, and linear analysis is used to explain the
                   underlying mechanisms. The dependence between the
                   surrounding medium's elasticity (shear modulus) and
                   the extent to which the effects of heat and mass
                   transfer influence bubble dynamics is quantified. In
                   particular, the oscillation properties are related to
                   the eigenvalues determined from linear theory.
                   Regimes under which a polytropic relation describes
                   the heat transfer to sufficient accuracy are
                   identified, for which the complexity and
                   computational expense associated with solving full
                   partial differential equations can be avoided.},

  abstract =      {The mechanical behavior of the lung tissue (expressed
                   by its constitutive equations) has considerable
                   influence on the normal and pathological function of
                   the lung. It determines the stress field in the
                   tissue, thus affecting the impedence and energy
                   consumption during breathing as well as the
                   localization of certain lung diseases. The lung
                   tissue has a complex mechanical response. It arises
                   from the tissue's structure--a cluster of a very
                   large number of closely packed airsacks (alveoli) and
                   air ducts. Each of the alveoli has a shape of
                   irregular polyhedron. It is bounded by the alveolar
                   wall membrane. In the present study, a stochastic
                   approach to the tissue's structure will be employed.
                   The density distribution function of the membrane's
                   orientation in space is considered as the predominant
                   structural parameter. Based on this model the present
                   theory relates the behavior of both the alveolar
                   membrane and that of its liquid interface to the
                   tissue's general constitutive properties. The
                   resulting equations allow for anisotropic and
                   visco-elastic effects. A protocol for material
                   characterization along the present model is proposed
                   as well. The methodology of the present theory is
                   quite general and can be similarly used with other
                   structural models of the lung tissue (e.g., models in
                   which the effect of the alveolar ducts is included).},

                   acting over the air-liquid interfaces. The tissue is
                   simulated using a visco-elastic model involving
                   nonlinear quasi-static stress-strain behavior
                   combined with a reduced relaxation function. The
                   surface tension force is simulated with a time- and
                   area-dependent model of surfactant behavior. The
                   model was used to simulate lung parenchyma under
                   three surface tension cases: air-filled,
                   liquid-filled, and lavaged with 3-dimenthyl siloxane,
                   which has a constant surface tension of 16 dyn/cm.
                   The dynamic elastance (Edyn) and tissue resistance
                   (Rti) were computed for sinusoidal tidal volume
                   oscillations over a range of frequencies from
                   0.16-2.0 Hz. A comparison of the variation of Edyn
                   and Rti with frequency between the model and
                   published experimental data showed good qualitative
                   agreement. Little difference was found in the model
                   between Rti for the air-filled and lavaged models; in
                   contrast, published data revealed a significantly
                   higher value of Rti in the lavaged lung. The absence
                   of a significant increase in Rti for the lavaged
                   model can be attributed to only minor changes in the
                   individual fiber bundle resistances with changes in
                   their configuration. The surface tension was found to
                   make an important contribution to both Edyn and Rti
                   in the air-filled duct model. It was also found to
                   amplify any existing tissue dissipative properties,

                   has long been recognised as a major challenge to
                   science and technology. As the area of interest
                   shifts towards the littoral, environmental influences
                   become dominant both in time and space. The manifold
                   challenges encompass prediction, measurement,
                   assessment, and adaptive responses to maximize the
                   effectiveness of systems. Although MCM and ASW
                   activities are dominated in different ways and scales
                   by the environment, both warfare areas have had to
                   consider the significantly changing requirements
                   posed by operations in the littoral. The fundamental
                   scientific issues involved in developing models
                   relating acoustics to the environment are matched in
                   difficulty by the need for data for their validation
                   and eventual practical use for prediction. In many
                   instances the need is for the longer term planning

                   acoustic signals transmitted from a source near Heard
                   Island in the southern Indian Ocean were monitored at
                   16 sites in the North and South Atlantic, the North
                   and South Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and the Southern
                   Ocean. The question posed by HIFT, whether at such
                   global ranges the signals would permit phase-coherent
                   processing and thus yield favorable signal-to-noise
                   levels, was answered in the affirmative. There was no
                   evidence of distress by the local marine mammal
                   population in response to the acoustic transmissions.
                   HIFT was prerequisite to a program for Acoustic

                   depends upon the ability to accurately predict the
                   performance of sonardetection algorithms in realistic
                   ocean environments. Such environments are typically
                   characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, thus
                   limiting the usefulness of performance prediction
                   approaches that assume a deterministic environment.
                   Here we derive closed-form receiver operating
                   characteristic (ROC) expressions for an optimal
                   Bayesian detector and for several typical suboptimal
                   detectors, based on a statistical model of
                   environmental uncertainty. Various scenarios extended
                   from an NRL benchmark shallow-water model were used
                   to check the analytical ROC expressions and to
                   illustrate the effect of environmental uncertainty on
                   detection performance. The results showed that (1)
                   optimal detection performance in an uncertain
                   environment in diffuse noise depends primarily on the
                   signal-to-noise ratio at the receivers and the rank
                   of the signal matrix, where the rank is an effective
                   representation of the scale of environmental
                   uncertainty; (2) the ROC expression for the optimal
                   Bayesian detector provides a more realistic
                   performance upper bound than that obtained from
                   conventional sonarequations that do not incorporate
                   environmental uncertainty; and (3) detection
                   performance predictions can be performed much faster
                   than with commonly used numerical methods such as
                   Monte Carlo performance evaluations.},

  abstract =      {As the international hydrographic community continues
                   to address the question of irreducible uncertainty in
                   modern surveys, a similar question must be asked of
                   archived vertical beam echosounder (VBES) and
                   leadline data sets. The Office of Naval Research
                   funded STRATAFORM project surveyed an area of the New
                   Jersey shelf around 39deg12' N 72deg50' W using an
                   EM1000 multibeam echosounder (MBES). This area is
                   also covered by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                   Administration surveys from 1936 to 1938 (from early
                   visual indicating fathometers) and 1975-1976 (VBES).
                   The analysis shows that the earlier data are biased
                   in deeper water, most probably because of
                   "hydrographic rounding" or instrument limitations,
                   and may be unrecoverable, but that the VBES data
                   appear approximately unbiased. Estimates of
                   uncertainty for a surface model generated from the
                   archive data are constructed, taking into account
                   measurement, interpolation, and hydrographic
                   uncertainty (addressing the problems of unobserved
                   areas and surface reconstruction stability).
                   Comparison of predicted depths against the MBES data
                   shows that the VBES-derived surface is consistent
                   given the quoted uncertainty and that the uncertainty
                   corresponds with appropriate hydrographic survey
                   standards. However, spatial aliasing of the VBES
                   surface is observed, which may be the limiting factor
                   in the applicability of this data},

  abstract =      {A common problem in sonar system prediction is that
                   the ocean environment is not well known. Utilizing
                   probabilistic based results from geoacoustic
                   inversions we characterize parameters relevant to
                   sonar performance. This paper describes the
                   estimation of transmission loss and its statistical
                   properties based on posterior parameter probabilities
                   obtained from inversion of ocean acoustic array data.
                   This problem is solved by first finding an ensemble
                   of relevant environmental model parameters and the
                   associated posterior probability using a likelihood
                   based inversion of the acoustic array data. In a
                   second step, each realization of these model
                   parameters is weighted with their posterior
                   probability to map into the transmission loss domain.
                   This approach is illustrated using vertical-array
                   data from a recent benchmark data set and from data
                   acquired during the Asian Seas International
                   Acoustics Experiment (ASIAEX) 2001 in the East China
                   Sea. The environmental parameters are first estimated
                   using a probabilistic-based geoacoustic inversion
                   technique. Based on the posterior probability that
                   each of these environmental models fits the ocean
                   acoustic array data, each model is mapped into
                   transmission loss. This enables us to compute a full
                   probability distribution for the transmission loss at
                   selected frequencies, ranges, and depths, which
                   potentially could be used for sonar performance

                   3, 2001, in the East China Sea (ECS), in a water
                   depth of approximately 100 m are presented.
                   Objectives of the data analysis are to explore the
                   stochastic nature of TL in terms of the mean (mu TL)
                   and the fluctuations around the mean (as described by
                   the standard deviation (sigmaTL) and higher order
                   statistics). In particular, we conjecture that muTL
                   robustly reflects the macrostate of the ocean,
                   including the bottom, whereas uncertainties in TL as
                   measured by sigmaTL are related to the microstate of
                   the ocean, again including the bottom. Comparisons
                   are made to TL data at a similar location, 200 km
                   from the ASIAEX site, in waters of the same depth, by
                   the Harsh Environment Program in September 1997. The
                   TL is shown to be approximately horizontally
                   isotropic with exception to a discrete anisotropic
                   feature likely caused by internal waves. Various
                   mechanisms of uncertainty are discussed to describe
                   the microstate. These were not sufficiently resolved

  abstract =      {A split-step Pad{\'{e}} solution is derived for the
                   parabolic equation (PE) method. Higher-order
                   Pad{\'{e}} approximations are used to reduce both
                   numerical errors and asymptotic errors (e.g., phase
                   errors due to wide-angle propagation). This approach
                   is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than
                   solutions based on Pad{\'{e}} approximations that
                   account for asymptotic errors but not numerical
                   errors. In constrast to the split-step Fourier
                   solution, which achieves similar efficiency for some
                   problems, the split-step Pad{\'{e}} solution is valid
                   for problems involving very wide propagation angles,
                   large depth variations in the properties of the
                   waveguide, and elastic ocean bottoms. The split-step
                   Pad{\'{e}} solution is practical for global-scale
                   problems.},

@book{Jensen2011,
abstract = {Senior level/graduate level text/reference presenting state-of-the- art numerical techniques to solve the wave equation in heterogeneous fluid-solid media. Numerical models have become standard research tools in acoustic laboratories, and thus computational acoustics is becoming an increasingly important branch of ocean acoustic science. The first edition of this successful book, written by the recognized leaders of the field, was the first to present a comprehensive and modern introduction to computational ocean acoustics accessible to students. This revision, with 100 additional pages, completely updates the material in the first edition and includes new models based on current research. It includes problems and solutions in every chapter, making the book more useful in teaching (the first edition had a separate solutions manual). The book is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students of acoustics, geology and geophysics, applied mathematics, ocean engineering or as a reference in computational methods courses, as well as professionals in these fields, particularly those working in government (especially Navy) and industry labs engaged in the development or use of propagating models.},
